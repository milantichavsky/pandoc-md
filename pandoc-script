# This script is used for converting .md files to .html files through utility called pandoc (which has to be
# installed on the machine). It lets you specify array of directories or files in arguments, so you don't
# have to convert them manually one by one. Script also checks for existing html files and if they are
# up to date (based on modification date difference between .md & .html) they don't get recompiled
# to prevent unnecessary writes.
########################

# This calls pandoc utility.
# `--quiet` to suppress warning messages, most of them just tell you that the header have not been specified.
# Either `--css=pandoc.css` or `-c pandoc.css` for specifying stylesheet

# information .html file is either recompiled or not. If there is no .html file yet, it is generated.
